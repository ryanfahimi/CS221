Ryan Fahimi - Project 4: Doubly Linked List

Successfully implemented and tested the doubly linked list project.
The program compiles and runs flawlessly, adhering to the GNU coding style.
All functionalities - Insert, Member, Delete, and Free_list - are working as expected.
The list maintains alphabetical order and avoids duplicates efficiently.
All test cases passed, confirming the robustness of the implementation.
Future work may include enhancing comments for better clarity.
