grep is a UNIX utility that is used to search for patterns in text files. 
It’s a powerful and versatile tool, and inthis project you will implement a version that,
while simplified, should still be useful. Your project is to complete the implementation of rgrep,
our simplified, restrictedgrep.rgrepis “restricted” in the sense that the patterns it
matches only support a few regular operators (the easier ones).  
The way rgrep is used is that a pattern is specified on the command line.
rgrep then reads lines from its standard input and prints them out on its standard 
output if and only if the pattern “matches” the line.
For example, we can use rgrep to search for lines that contain text file names that are at least 3 characters
long (plus the extension) in a file like thefollowing:
