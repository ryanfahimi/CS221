The bug in the original code was the use of an uninitialized pointer `array1`. 

Here is the problematic line from the original code:
*(array1 + 4) = 0x01;

The bug is that `array1` was never initialized; it was simply declared:
int *array1;

In C, local variables are not automatically initialized.
When the program tries to write to this location, it causes undefined behavior, which in this case manifests as a segmentation fault. 
A segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it's not allowed to, and the operating system forcibly terminates the program as a result.

To fix this bug, `array1` needs to be initialized to point to a valid memory location before it is used. 
In the context of the original program, it seems that the intention was for `array1` to point to the `array` variable. 
Therefore, the fix involves adding a line of code to initialize `array1`:
array1 = array;

This line sets `array1` to point to the first element of `array`, and after this point, `array1` can be safely used to access and modify the elements of `array`.
